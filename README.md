Effect of Radiation and Diet on Aortic damage


Files: 
aorta2.txt: Dataset consisting of 5 variables and 80 observations. 
Aorta.RMD: full R-Markdown code used to perform EDA, Statistical Analysis and Visualizations.
Aorta.html:  Output file. Analysis report with presentation of statistical results, graphs and results interpretation in a 'journal like' manner.

Summary:
The dataset was obtained from ‘Análisis de la Varianza: Carrera de Especialización en Estadísticas para Ciencias de la Salud (CEECS). Universidad de Buenos Aires. Instituto de Cálculo’.

The Experiment: 
40 Mice were treated with ionizing radiation (four different intensities) and exposed to standard or high-fat diet. Mice were divided equally between treatments and two samples were obtained per mouse to determine aortic area lesion. 

Statistical Analysis and Model:
Mixed ANOVA model was proposed to analyze differences between treatment combinations. 

Statistical and Visualization tools: 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Statistical Analysis were performed with R. Visualization of data and results were done mostly with ggplot2 and sjPlot.
